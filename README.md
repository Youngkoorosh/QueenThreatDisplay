## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **`QueenThreatDisplay`**! This simple yet effective Python script visualizes the threat range of a Queen on an empty $8 \times 8$ chessboard. When you input the Queen's position (e.g., `d4`), it will display the board, marking all squares threatened horizontally, vertically, and diagonally with an asterisk (`X`), while clearly showing the Queen's position (`Q`).

This project serves as a personal learning endeavor, allowing me to dive deeper into fundamental Python concepts and chess logic:

* **Input Handling:** Efficiently processing user input for chess coordinates.
* **Coordinate Transformation:** Converting standard chess notation (`a1`, `h8`) into array-friendly numerical indices.
* **Chess Piece Movement Logic:** Implementing the complex $8$-directional movement of a Queen.
* **2D Array Visualization:** Representing and displaying a chessboard using nested loops.
* **Conditional Logic:** Applying `if/elif/else` statements for precise visual output.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Queen Placement:** Specify the Queen's starting position (e.g., `e4`).
* **Full Threat Visualization:** Displays squares threatened across all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.
* **Clear Board Representation:** Uses `*` for threatened squares, `Q` for the Queen's position, and `.` for empty, safe squares.
* **Standard Chess Notation Support:** Accepts input in standard algebraic notation (e.g., `a1`, `h8`).

## üíª How to Use

To run this script and see the Queen's threat range:

1.  **Save the code:**
    Save your Python code (the complete version we worked on) into a file named `main.py` (or any other `.py` file).

2.  **Run from your terminal:**
    Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using your terminal or command prompt, then execute:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  **Enter the Queen's position:**
    The script will prompt you to enter the Queen's position (e.g., `d7`). Type it and press `Enter`.

4.  **Observe the output:**
    The chessboard will then be printed in your terminal, showing the Queen and its threatened squares.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Learning

As a 19-year-old developer passionate about Python, this project is a step in my continuous learning journey. It's a hands-on exercise in translating real-world rules (like chess piece movements) into concise and efficient code. I've focused on mastering:

* The power of `ord()` for character-to-number conversions.
* Precise string slicing and `int()` conversions.
* Strategic use of nested loops for board traversal.
* Careful ordering of conditional checks to ensure accurate display.

I'm always eager to learn and improve! Feel free to provide feedback, suggest enhancements, or discuss different approaches.
